# Contributing to CSS

Thanks for your interest in contributing to `css`! We welcome new contributions regardless of your level of experience or familiarity with PureScript.

Every library in the Contributors organization shares a simple handbook that helps new contributors get started. With that in mind, please [read the short contributing guide on purescript-contrib/governance](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/governance/blob/main/contributing.md) before contributing to this library.

## Planning your submission

> :information_source: This library is, in large part, a port of Haskell's [Clay](http://github.com/sebastiaanvisser/clay).

Please try to align your code changes with that library if possible. This can reduce our maintenance effort over time.
